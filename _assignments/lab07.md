## Requirements

1. For this lab, please use an incremental development approach and commit two top-level circuits: `lab07-part1.dig` and `lab07-part2.dig`. 
1. Each top-level circuit should contain its own decoder circuit to identify instructions and propagate the appropriate control signals. 
1. For this lab you will combine your work from lab06 with a new implementation of the control lines as described in the [Project 06 Guide Part 2](/docs/project06-part-2.html)
1. Use the spreadsheet approach to develop a decoder table that associated inputs (opcode, funct3, funct7, and funct6) with decoder outputs (`RFW`, `ALUOp`, etc.).
1. You must have inputs for `CLK`, `EN`, `CLR`, and `PROG`, and outputs for `A0`, `A1`, `A2` and `DONE`

## Part 1

1. Build decoders (for instructions, registers, and immediates) and top-level processor circuit which can execute this program (also given in the Guide)

    ```
    first_s:
        li a0, 1
        li a1, 2
        add a2, a0, a1
        unimp
    ```
## Part 2

1. Build the control and top-level processor circuit which can execute this program (also given in the Guide)
    ```
    main:    
        li a0, 1
        li a1, 2
        jal first_s
        unimp
    first_s:
        add a0, a0, a1
        ret
    ```
## Given

1. You may use any of the circuits shown in the [Project 06 Guide Part 2]({{ site.url }}/docs/project06-part-2.html)
1. You may use any of Digital's built-in components, or your own if you prefer.
